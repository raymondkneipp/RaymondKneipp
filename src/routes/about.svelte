          Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Raymond Kneipp, and I am a freelance web developer. I live
          and work in Cincinnati, OH. I spend most of my days either trying to
          keep up with the ever-changing web development ecosystem or coming up
          with ideas for new personal projects.

        <p class="text-white text-lg">
          I created my first website in 2014 with PHP. I believe I got into web
          development because I always enjoyed building things but did not like
          the cost of robotic kits. The website was for a local Boy Scout troop
          that I happened to be a part of. The website offered user
          authentication so that scouts could log in and check to see how much
          money they had in their scouting accounts.

          As years went by, I greatly improved my web development skills. In
          late 2018 I enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves. After training, I
          discovered Angular and React.js. After trying out the two frameworks,
          I decided to pursue learning React. To test out my new React skills, I
          created a website for a family friend's salon called <Link
            light
            href="https://beauty-bratz.netlify.app/"
            arrow={false}
            external>Beauty Bratz</Link
          >. Soon after, I worked with a local flight enthusiast club and made
          them a website which can be found <Link
            href="https://eaachapter174.org/"
            light
            external
            arrow={false}>here</Link
          >.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white text-lg">
          I began to focus on helping small businesses establish their online
          presence by designing and building attractive, professional, and
          SEO-optimized websites.
